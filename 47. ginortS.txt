Difficulty: Easy
Solution: 

testStr = input()


lower = [x for x in testStr if(x.islower())]
lower.sort()

upper = [x for x in testStr if(x.isupper())]
upper.sort()

odd = [x for x in testStr if(x.isdigit() and int(x)%2==1)]
odd.sort()

even = [x for x in testStr if(x.isdigit() and int(x)%2==0)]
even.sort()


print("".join(lower + upper + odd + even))
